# 🌴 palm-traceability-system

This repository contains the core components of a qualitative research and system design project focused on developing a **blockchain-based traceability system** for Indonesia’s palm oil export supply chain. The goal is to improve **transparency**, **regulatory compliance**, and **supply chain trust** using smart contracts and stakeholder-informed design.

## 📦 Contents

- **Expert_Interview_Guide.pdf**  
  A semi-structured guide for expert interviews with palm oil supply chain actors (farmers, mills, refineries, regulators, exporters, manufactures, and retailers).

- **Evaluation.pdf**  
  Likert-scale evaluation from 30 stakeholders covering perceptions of system usability, trust, and regulatory support.

- **StakeholderRegistry.sol**  
  Manages registration and access control for different actor roles (e.g., farmer, mill, exporter). Supports role-based permissions.

- **StakeholderDataRecording.sol**  
  Records traceability data across palm oil transactions (origin, volume, documentation). Ensures tamper-proof tracking.

- **TraceabilityViewQR.sol**  
  Enables QR-based document and product verification. Allows external parties (e.g., consumers, auditors) to view certification status.

## 📝 Description

This project demonstrates how blockchain smart contracts can power a decentralized traceability system for palm oil exports.  
It is informed by expert interviews and stakeholder evaluations to ensure the system aligns with operational needs and policy frameworks such as **RSPO**, **ISPO**, and **EUDR**.

The smart contracts automate:
- Stakeholder onboarding and access control  
- Recording of palm oil movement and certification metadata  
- Transparent verification via QR code
